								<p>In this fair, my partner and I conducted an experiment to test the effects of low gravitational levels on plants
								that were dominated by either phototropism or gravitropism(geotropism).  For this project, my friend and I won the AIAA award,
								in which we were granted a 3 day scholarship program at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to tour facilities closed to the public.
								In addition, we were invited to join the top aerospace officials at the AIAA Capital Sector Banquet.</p>

								<li class="icon fa-rocket">
									<h3>NASA Scholarship</h3>
									<p>In this program, I was able to tour NASA Goddard Space Flight Center facilities that were closed to the public and opened only once every 5 to 10 years.  In addition, I was able to tour the Wallops Island NASA Facilites on Wallops Island, and talk to the people who work there about their projects and inventions.  I was able to see the manufacturing of the James Webb Telescope Mirrors, along with the rooms and machines used to test the quality of the products.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-calculator">
									<h3>Virginia Math League</h3>
									<p>In this competition, I won third place at my school out the 40 kids who took the test.  My score was 32/36 and I was recognized along with my peers as T4th/25th in the Virginia Math League School Competition during the 2013-2014 school year.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-github">
									<h3>National Latin Exam</h3>
									<p></p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-futbol-o">
									<h3>Varsity Tennis</h3>
									<p>I made the school Varsity Tennis Team as a freshman was a seeded player on the team.  I was selected to play in the school conference tournament and won both my singles matches and one out of the two doubles matches in the conference semifinals.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-heart-o">
									<h3>Volunteering</h3>
									<p>I have logged over 50 volunteering hours at various events, such as the local library, school events, and at religious centers such as my local temples.  I help in a lot of ways, such as running events and helping with set up and clean up.  At the religious centers, I participate with priests
									in various religious rituals such as the recitation of scriptures and prayers.  It is a very rewarding experience as volunteering helps me give back to the community, as it has helped me in the past as well.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-flag-o">
									<h3>Hobbies/Interests</h3>
									<p>I am very interested in building circuit boards.  I have built watches and sound to light converters using these circuit boards and soldering machines.  In addition, I also like to wind down by watching sporting events such as football and tennis, watching the Seattle Seahawks and Roger Federer play, respectectively.  I also like
									to watch movies on the weekends and play video games in my spare time.</p>
